# udl_deployment_project

This repository contains the code used for the project about deployment of machine learning models using AWS, in Udacity's 
Deep Learning nano-degree 
(see [nano-degree repo here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)).

The main file in this project is [sagemaker_project.ipynb](/sagemaker_project.ipynb) which contains 
the project instructions as well as the implementations of the requested features I provided for the project.

The notebook is also available in [html format](/report.html).

*Remark*: Commit message practice is to use minimal commit message and always reference any development to a related issue. 
Work description details is located in the issue ticket comments when relevant.
